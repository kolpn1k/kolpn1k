- 👋 Hi, I’m _Vladyslav_
- 👀 I’m interested in Front-End React field. I have 2.2 years of commercial experience working with such technologies as **React, Redux, JavaScript, HTML, CSS (SCSS/SASS, LESS), GIT, Jenkins, Postman**
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **TypeScript** and **Cypress/Jest** as for both E2E and unit tests
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting projects on which it's applicable to work with **ukrainians**. As far as I understand most of foreign countries freeze hiring ukrainians because of russian invasion. On my opinion it's much better to hire our participants to help Ukraine economy come back and win russia faster
- 📫 You can reach me both in Telegram or LinkedIn by **@kolpn1k** nickname. **Have a nice day**, reader :)
